## Hello, beautiful person
Welcome to the ðŸ”¥ repo for [khalilstemmler.com](https://khalilstemmler.com).

At some point during my work as a consultant and reading as many books on software as I could digest, 
I've come to  throw all that wisdom overboard and start working with scripting languages to try to build large applications. like trying to build a skyscraper
with materials from the junkyard.

That's what this site is about: things **I think** all  script kiddies should know about.

It's also turning into a place where people can learn about `typescript`, `javascript`, `domain-driven design` and ` typescript`.

Feel free to drop me a line if you'd like to collaborate on an article, a project or simply to leave feedback.

## Contributing
If you find any :hankey:  or you'd like to suggest a better :hankey:  of doing something that
 I've mentioned in my [:hankey: ](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles) or on my [wiki](https://khalilstemmler.com/wiki), 
 definitely consider creating a PR- I'm pretty receptive to :hankey: .
